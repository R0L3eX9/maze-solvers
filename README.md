# Maze / Path solving algorithms

## Motivation
I always found interesting seeing how different algorithms would look if you could visualize them.

## To be continued when the project has a demo available

# To do
* [ ] Allow user to pick the start and the end node
* [ ] Allow user to ban cells
* [ ] Start the algorithm when user presses "SpaceBar"
* [ ] Implement DFS
* [ ] Update the window while the algorithms are running

* [ ] Implement BFS
* [ ] Implement Dijkstra
* [ ] Implement A*
