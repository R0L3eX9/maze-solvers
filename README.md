# Maze / Path solving algorithms

## Motivation
I always found interesting seeing how different algorithms would look if you could visualize them.

## Using
You need:
* Git
* Python3
* Pip
* PyGame

```
git clone git@github.com:R0L3eX9/maze-solvers.git
cd maze-solver
python3 main.py
```

You will be prompt with a grid of cells.

You first have to select the starting cell (marked with red) by using left click,
then you have to
pick the ending cell, after that you are allowed to ban cells as well as remove theme
using right click. Once you are pleased with your setup you can press "Return" to start the algorithm.

# To do
* [x] Allow user to pick the start and the end node
* [x] Allow user to ban cells
* [x] Start the algorithm when user presses "Return"
* [ ] Implement DFS
* [x] Update the window while the algorithms are running

* [x] Implement BFS
* [ ] Implement Dijkstra
* [ ] Implement A*
